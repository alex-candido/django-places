## The Install Worked Successfully! Congratulations!

If you're seeing this page (usually at `http://localhost:8000/`), it means:

* The Django framework has been **installed correctly**.
* Your `settings.py` file has `DEBUG=True`.
* You have **not yet configured any URL patterns** for your project.

This is a great indicator that your development environment is up and running!
